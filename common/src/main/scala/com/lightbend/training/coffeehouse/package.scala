/**
  * Package objects are a convenient container shared across an entire package
  *
  * They can contain arbitrary definitions, not just just variable & method defs.
  * They are often used to hold package-wide type aliases & implicit conversions.
  * Package objects can even inherit Scala classes & traits.
  *
  * By convention, it lives in a source file called package.scala.
  * Each package is allowed to have one package object.
  * Andy defs placed in the package object are considered members of the package itself.
  *
  * They are just like other objects - meaning can used inheritance for building them.
